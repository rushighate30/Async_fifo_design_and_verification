<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This project presents the design and verification of an <strong>Asynchronous FIFO (First-In, First-Out)</strong> memory structure,
  developed to achieve reliable <strong>Clock Domain Crossing (CDC)</strong> between two asynchronous clock domains. The main objective
  is to ensure safe and efficient data transfer while minimizing synchronization errors and avoiding metastability issues.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The FIFO employs independent <strong>read</strong> and <strong>write pointers</strong>, each operating in separate clock domains.
  To prevent metastability during pointer synchronization, a <strong>Gray code counter</strong> is implemented, ensuring only one bit
  changes during transitions. The design also includes <strong>Gray-to-Binary conversion</strong> logic for accurate address calculation
  and status flag generation, such as <code>full</code> and <code>empty</code> conditions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A <strong>two-flip-flop (2FF) synchronizer</strong> technique is used to synchronize pointer values across clock domains, effectively
  reducing the chances of metastable behavior. The design is modular, consisting of multiple Verilog files that handle specific
  functionalities such as memory storage, pointer control, and synchronization.

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
  <li>The FIFO design ensures reliable CDC and stable data transfer under asynchronous clock operation.</li>
  <li>SystemVerilog-based testbench verification validates functionality across different timing scenarios.</li>
  <li>The approach demonstrates a practical and reusable solution for FPGA and SoC-based system integration.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Overall, this Asynchronous FIFO design provides a robust mechanism for handling data communication between independent clock domains,
  combining efficient synchronization techniques with thorough functional verification.

  <h3 id="readwrite">Read and Write Operations</h3>
  <h4 id="operations">Operations</h4>
<p>In an asynchronous FIFO, the read and write operations are managed by separate clock domains. The write pointer always points to the next word to be written. On a FIFO-write operation, the memory location pointed to by the write pointer is written, and then the write pointer is incremented to point to the next location to be written. Similarly, the read pointer always points to the current FIFO word to be read. On reset, both pointers are set to zero. When the first data word is written to the FIFO, the write pointer increments, the empty flag is cleared, and the read pointer, which is still addressing the contents of the first FIFO memory word, immediately drives that first valid word onto the FIFO data output port to be read by the receiver logic. The FIFO is empty when the read and write pointers are both equal, and it is full when the write pointer has wrapped around and caught up to the read pointer.</p>

  <h4 id="conditions">Full, Empty and Wrapping Condition</h4>
<h3>Full, Empty, and Wrapping Condition</h3>

<p align="justify">
  The conditions for the FIFO to be full or empty are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Empty Condition:</strong>  
    The FIFO is empty when the read and write pointers are both equal. This condition happens when both pointers are reset to zero during a reset operation, or when the read pointer catches up to the write pointer, having read the last word from the FIFO.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Full Condition:</strong>  
    The FIFO is full when the write pointer has wrapped around and caught up to the read pointer. This means that the write pointer has incremented past the final FIFO address and has wrapped around to the beginning of the FIFO memory buffer.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Wrapping Around Condition:</strong>  
    To distinguish between the full and empty conditions when the pointers are equal, an extra bit is added to each pointer. This extra bit helps in identifying whether the pointers have wrapped around:
    <ul>
      <li>
        When the write pointer increments past the final FIFO address, it will increment the unused Most Significant Bit (MSB) while setting the rest of the bits back to zero.
      </li>
      <li>
        The same is done with the read pointer. If the MSBs of the two pointers are different, it means that the write pointer has wrapped one more time than the read pointer.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the MSBs of the two pointers are the same, it means that both pointers have wrapped the same number of times.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
  This design technique helps in accurately determining the full and empty conditions of the FIFO.
